- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicpalmer
- 👀 I’m interested in Security, and Observability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go, and I'd like to look into Rust. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source tools that help the Blue Team, or non-profits that want to do more around Security.
- 📫 How to reach me; raise an issue https://github.com/nicpalmer/nicpalmer OR drop me an email nic[@]salopiansecurity.co.uk
